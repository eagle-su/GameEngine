 HLActionManager the object that manages all the actions.
 Normally you won't need to use this API directly. 99% of the cases you will use the CCNode interface, which uses this object.
 But there are some cases where you might need to use this API directly:
 Examples:
 - When you want to run an action where the target is different from a CCNode.
 - When you want to pause / resume the actions
