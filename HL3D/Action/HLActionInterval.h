/** an interval action is an action that takes place within a certain period of time
    it has an start time ,and a finish time . the finish time is the parameter duration
    plus the start time 
 
    these HLActionIntervalactions have some interesting properties, like:
    - they can run normally 
    - they can run reversed with the reverse method
    - they can run with the time alterd with the accelerate ,accelDeccel and Speed actions
     For example, you can simulate a Ping Pong effect running the action normally and
     then running it again in Reverse mode.
     
     Example:
     
     HLAction * pingPongAction = [HLSequence actions: action, [action reverse], nil];
